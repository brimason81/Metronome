- Made .control button circular
- Revised bpm calculation
- Created control() - this method is called from start(), and changes the background color, and 
                        innerHTML of the button 

TO DO:

- Change shape of button - triangle (play); square (stop).  Use method to make these changes
- **RESOLVED 11/10**  Double-check bpm calculation:  The interval at which the color changes is not correct.
- bpm calculation needs to change as the tempo is raised/lowered.

- bpm calcualtion is fixed through setBpm() 
    ...still needs to update in real time.

-startStopButton() 
    - calls start() & stop()
        - stop() calls clearInterval, but a value remains - WHY:  **RESOLVED:  NEEDED DIFFERENT CONDITION
                                                                    IN if STATEMENT.  USED boolean INSTEAD OF 
                                                                    if (interval).
                                                                
- **RESOLVED** need to fix rate of color change - does not reflect tempo.

- AudioContext working, sort of:
    - clicks are sounding, but are interval is irregular, and seems a bit random.
    - WARNING:  AudioContext was not allowed to start...
