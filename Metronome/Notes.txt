- Made .control button circular
- Revised bpm calculation
- Created control() - this method is called from start(), and changes the background color, and 
                        innerHTML of the button 

TO DO:

- Change shape of button - triangle (play); square (stop).  Use method to make these changes
- Double-check bpm calculation:  The interval at which the color changes is not correct.
- bpm calculation needs to change as the tempo is raised/lowered.
